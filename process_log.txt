Process log

Here you can find a log behind steps what we did with the data. The log isn't all-inclusive as we started
writing it after several steps were already completed. It however should still give a pretty good
point of view in the process in general.

Steps
------

1. Original traffic accident and road usages (0_0_road_usages.csv) datas were downloaded from avoindata.fi.
   The traffic accidents data was combined (originally annual csv files), and columns Oslakpvm and Luovpvm
   were removed from the combined file. This is how 0_accidents.csv was made.


2. Manual "Find & Replace All" process was used to fix erroneous UTF-8 encoding of roads' names in 0_0_road_usages.csv,
   and this is how 0_1_road_usages.csv was made.

   Changes:
    - Faulty Ä and Ö marks were replaced with correct Ä (0xC384) and Ö (0xC396).
      For example L�NSIV�YL� was changed into LÄNSIVÄYLÄ.


3. Code file 1_remove_accidents_columns.py removes unnecessary columns from 0_accidents.csv and outputs 1_accidents.csv.


4. Code file 2_modify_road_usages_names.py does more changes to names of certain streets in 0_1_road_usages.csv.
   It drops some uncertain road-names. It outputs 2_road_usages.csv.


5. Code file 3_drop_additional_road_usages_measurements.py drops rows that are measurements of a road that already
   has another measurement point. This simplifies visualization later on. It outputs 3_road_usages.csv.


6. Code file 4_merge_road_usages_hours.py combines rows of 3_road_usages.csv by setting all the entries being hourly.
   Originally the entries were either formed in 15-minute or 1-hour scale.
   It also sums over rows which are of same road, year and hour, but have different 'suunta' values.
   Outputs 4_road_usages.csv.


6. Code file 5_change_accidents_katuosoite.py formats road-addresses of 1_accidents.csv to match 4_road_usges.csv
   -file's address-names. Outputs 5_accidents.csv.


7. Code file 6_select_accidents_in_road_usages.py filters accidents by road-names, which should be common with latest road-usages.
   Takes 5_accidents.csv and 4_road_usages.csv as input. Outputs 6_accidents.csv.
