Process log

Here you can find a log behind steps what we did with the data. The log isn't all-inclusive as we started
writing it after several steps were already completed. It however should still give a pretty good
point of view in the process in general.

Steps
------

1. Original traffic accident and road usages (0_road_usages.csv) datas were downloaded from avoindata.fi.
   The traffic accidents data was combined (originally annual csv files), and columns Oslakpvm and Luovpvm
   were removed from the combined file. This is how 0_accidents.csv was made.


2. Code file 1.py removes unnecessary columns from 0_accidents.csv and outputs 1_accidents.csv.


3. Manual "Find & Replace All" process for fixing erroneous UTF-8 encoding of 0_road_usages.csv.
   This included changing "faulty-Ä" and "faulty-Ö" marks into "Ä" and "Ö" (0xC384, 0xC396).

   At the same time, some road names were also modified. For example "V. PORVOONTIE" was changed into "VANHA PORVOONTIE",
   and "KEHÄ III" into "KEHÄ 3".


4. Code file 2.py combines rows of 1_road_usages.csv by setting all the entries being hourly.
   Originally the entries were either formed in 15-minute or 1-hour scale.
