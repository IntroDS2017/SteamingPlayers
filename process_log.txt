Process log
------------

Here you can find a log behind steps what we did with the data. The log isn't all-inclusive as we started
writing it after several steps were already completed. It however should still give a pretty good
point of view in the process in general.

Steps
------

1. Original traffic accident and road usages (0_road_usages.csv) datas were downloaded from avoindata.fi.
   The traffic accidents data was combined (originally annual csv files), and columns Oslakpvm and Luovpvm
   were removed from the combined file. This is how 0_accidents.csv was made.


2. Code file 1.py removes unnecessary columns from 0_accidents.csv and outputs 1_accidents.csv.


3. Manual "Find & Replace All" process was used to fix erroneous UTF-8 encoding of roads' names in 0_road_usages.csv,
   and this is how 2_road_usages.csv was made.

   Changes:
    - Faulty Ä and Ö marks were replaced with correct Ä (0xC384) and Ö (0xC396).
      For example L�NSIV�YL� was changed into LÄNSIVÄYLÄ.


4. Code 2.py does more changes to names of certain streets in 2_road_usages.csv. It outputs 3_road_usages.csv.


5. Code file 3.py combines rows of 3_road_usages.csv by setting all the entries being hourly.
   Originally the entries were either formed in 15-minute or 1-hour scale.
